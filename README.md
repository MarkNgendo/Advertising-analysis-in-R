## Specifying the Question

A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

## Data Relevance

The data set can be gotten from this [Link](http://bit.ly.IPAdvertisingData) 
Below is the glossary:

* Daily time spent - Specifies how many minutes an individual spends on site in a day
* Age - Age of the individual
* Area Income
* Daily Internet Usage - total minutes spent on the internet by the individual
* Ad Topic Line - title of the Ad presented to the Individual
* City - City the individual resides in
* Male - Binary (0: Female/Not Male, 1: Male)
* Country - Country the individual resides in
* Time stamp
* Clicked on Ad - Binary(0: No, 1: Yes)

## Objectives
### Overall Objectives
*To identify the individuals that are most likely to click on the client’s ads

### Specific Objectives
* To identify the blog’s key demographic in terms of age group, gender and country of origin.
* To examine the relationship between time spent on the blog and daily internet usage when it comes to clicking on ads.

## Recommendations
From the above analysis, the following points stand out:

* The demographic of the Blogger consists of:

    - equal numbers of both Male and Non-male users,
    - high numbers of people aged between 25 and 40
    - male users click on ads slightly less than their counterparts.

* The people most likely to click on ads spend not more than 60 minutes in a day on the site.

* The client should therefore tailor the ads towards meeting the needs of this specific demographic
